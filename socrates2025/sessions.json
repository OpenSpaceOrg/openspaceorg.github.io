Most of these notes suffer from the “long and illegible” syndrome, which is why they quickly end up in the waste paper. These notes often don't help us to remember the important things. But that's exactly why we created them!\n\nIn my workshop, you will see how you can integrate sketchnotes into your everyday work as a techie and what advantages they have for you. You'll find out what sketchnotes are, how you can use them for your purposes and how they ensure that you can finally remember the important things. So that you go home with all the important tools, we will draw some frequently used symbols in software development and architecture together step by step.\n\nYou've come to the right place if you finally want to make your notes more helpful. You don't need an A in art to do this, just a desire to try something new.\n\nLook forward to a cool impulse for your SoCraTes notes.\n\nGet your pens ready, go!","people":[{"id":"3025027","name":"Lisa Maria Schäfer"}]},

But are those tests sufficient? Coverage tools provide an answer.\nUnfortunately, coverage analysis is often insufficient. Even test suites with 100% code coverage often miss bugs. Some test suites bring only little added value in practice.\n\nWith Mutation Testing you can check the quality of your tests yourself! Stryker (JS/TS, C#, Scala) puts your tests to the test. You get a more realistic statement, how well your suite can actually find errors and learn how to improve it. The tool integrates into your project and pipeline with little effort and gets results fast!\n\nLearning Objectives:\n- Understand why 100% coverage means little\n- Integrate Stryker into your own projects\n- Improve test suites with the help of mutation reports","people":[{"id":"3025032","name":"Marco Emrich"}]},

It is free, open source and distributed. It claims to be easy to learn. In this training we will fill this claim with life. We will start with the very basics, creating a git repository, looking into this lurking .git folder, creating commits and have a closer look at git objects and logs. We will branch, merge and rebase. And of course we will rewrite history, go hunting for lost commits and push and pull. And the best of it: We will do all this with a terminal!\n\nThe goal of this training is twofold: Become comfortable using git is the obvious one. The more hidden one is to also get comfortable using CLI tools. Both goals can only be reached when we do it hands-on. Therefore, you will need to bring a device with git and your favourite terminal installed. For Windows users I recommend to use git-bash which comes with the standard installation of git for Windows.","people":[{"id":"3025035","name":"Martin Schmidt"}]},

But some issues are impossible to solve just by assumption, and even with great experience, it’s quite common to get the first design at least partially wrong.\n\nUnfortunately, the first design is also often the one that ends up being implemented.\n\nOn a technical level, this has immediate consequences: If we assume boundaries in the wrong place, or forget or omit important aspects of communication, we can end up with brittle services, performance issues, and needlessly coupled modules and components, which are painful to maintain and deploy.\nOn an organizational level, misplaced boundaries and unfortunate design decisions often lead to entire team structures and workflows in all the wrong places, thus creating immense communication overhead, or worse: active prevention of learning and improvement for the rest of the project lifetime.\n\nOne way to mitigate the impact of those decisions, and to verify our initial assumptions, is to start implementation not with a complete solution architecture in mind, but rather with the smallest possible footprint: A plain, but fully operational prototype of the domain model, which we can stress, observe and explore - and change easily, if we run into problems. This way, we can actually see our design work, and gain valuable insights.\n\nAs a side-effect, we can also deliver customer value much earlier, by using the raw domain model to power UX/UI prototypes - replacing fakes and click-dummies with a working application.\nAs a team, we can learn and improve together, making important decisions when they are needed, adding layer by layer of additional (technical) complexity in small, incremental steps, until we are truly ready to scale out.\n\nWe will play through a full development cycle of a (fictitious) business application to explore how combining UX prototyping, Domain Driven Design, and the practices, heuristics and principles of Software Crafting can highlight difficult or problematic choices, improve fundamental architecture decisions, and ultimately lead not only to better solutions, but also to a better and more sustainable software development process.","people":[{"id":"3025029","name":"Tobias Goeschel"}]},

Participants will understand the surprising truth behind the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle and why repeating yourself can be beneficial specifically in testing contexts.\n\nFinally, attendees will learn how to sustainably maintain and systematically organize tests over time, avoiding common maintenance headaches and keeping their test suites robust and relevant.

Fields, like software development, that tend toward highly complex and \"wicked\" problems require ever-evolving responses and supportive behavior.\n\nOne such shift has us wrestling with the nuanced definition of \"workplace.\" Another theme is \"work time.” A further shift moves us away from expecting single, smart, geniuses-in-a-closet working alone to find solutions, and working under a leader/manager tasked with appraising and stimulating individual performance. This shift then moves us toward our current understanding that the answers we seek will only emerge from people working together to share what they know, as collaborative teams of motivated learners. The quest for learning new approaches and adopting new technologies galvanizes their performance.\n\nWhat are team members’ and leaders’ roles in setting the context for such new work? What familiar collaboration and coaching skills still apply? What new habits of behavior will we practice? What will nurture the growth of team co-intelligence to meet the challenges of tomorrow? In this short workshop, we will explore these questions and more, as groups of leaders, team members, and practitioners create new approaches together.\n\n\nAudience:\n- Team members and team-adjacent leaders, coaches, and collaborators\n\nPrerequisite:\n- Experience in team-based work environment\n- Attend workshop with specific team in mind\n- Willingness to share experiences with other participants\n\nOutline:\n- Introduction\n- Essential Team Motivators\n- Knowledge Work and Learning Work\n- Multiple Intelligences\n- Trust - From ICs to Teams\n- 4c’s for Team Learning Work\n- Learning Transfer\n- What’s Next?\n\nLearning Outcomes:\nParticipants will:\n\n- Identify the role qualities for non-traditional settings, familiar and new\n- Describe the connection between continuous learning and evolving co-intelligence for teams\n- Create a draft personal development plan for the work world of tomorrow","people":[{"id":"3025031","name":"Diana Larsen"}]},
